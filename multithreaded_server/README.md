Instructions: To run and test httpserver use the command make to parse the included Makefile.
This will generate an executable called httpserver which can then be called with ./httpserver <port number>. Optionally httpserver can be called with -N <thread count> or -l <log_name> for a different thread count or to enable logs.
After running the executable httpserver will be up and can recieve http requests over the specified port.
Makefile also includes clean which deletes .o files.
